title: micro-ROS for extremely resource constrained devices
abstract:
  While standard ROS2 can run on Linux-class embedded devices, smaller micro-controllers are still a challenge. 
  For example, ARM Cortex-M3 and -M4 class micro-controllers are popular for motion control and sensor integration,
  but have little RAM and storage. Also, they are often running with small batteries, e.g. for environmental sensors, 
  or small consumer robots, which requires efficient power management. micro-ROS aims to address these devices through 
  a combination of specialized, but ROS2 interoperable, communication, as well as the use of small Real-Time Operating 
  Systems (RTOSs).
